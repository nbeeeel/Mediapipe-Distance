## Methodology
Here in this project we leveraged the z-axis of particular landmarks to approximate the distance of the landmark from camera.
This is a straightforward approach towards monocular depth estimation without any calibration or reference distance measurements.

## Environment Creation 

Open Command Prompt and follow these steps:

### For Python Env
```
python -m venv D:/ENVS/MP-Distance
MP-Distance\Script\activate
```
### For Conda Env
```
conda env create -f <ENV NAME>
conda activate <ENV NAME>
```
## Install Recommended Packages via requirements.txt file 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
